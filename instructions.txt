Thank you for using Ida.
I made it to help devs and end users perform repetitive UI tests.
For any questions write me to uros.dolzan@gmail.com


1. Prerequisites

Currently only Google Chrome is supported.
You'll need to learn how to find elements. You can do it in no time,
check the links:
- https://www.wikihow.com/Inspect-Element-on-Chrome
- https://www.toolsqa.com/selenium-webdriver/inspect-element-in-chrome/
  (search for: Inspect the elements using the DOM panel of DevTools)

You will see that every element can have various attributes. For testing with Ida
search for: id, class and name. You will want unique identifier to make sure
Ida will operate with desired element.


2. Project setup

Go to folder sequence and find settings.json. Enter desired url i.e.::

{
	"url": "https://www.nb3.si"
}


3. Start creating sequences.
You can split testing scenarios over multiple .json files and
control execution order with naming files (there are no rules), i.e.:

100_login.json
200_modify_address.json
300_create_new_article.json

Inside every json file you can have as many sequences as you need. You only have to be careful to maintain
valid json format of the file.

desc: for describing element
type: can be "input" (i.e. textfield, dropdown, etc.) or "click" (choosing menu, click button)
input: text you wish to insert when using type "input"

element can be bound by id, name, class or xpath - containing text. Obviously, you need only one of these elements.

{
	"seq": [{
	        "desc": "Register: username",
	        "type": "input",
			"name": "Username",   // find textfield by name
			"input": "uros"
		},
		{
			"desc": "Register: password",
			"type": "input",
			"name": "Password",  // find textfield by name
			"input": "123456"
		},
		{
	        "desc": "Register button pressed",
			"type": "click",
			"xpath": "REGISTER",   // find button by searching containing text
		}
	]
}
